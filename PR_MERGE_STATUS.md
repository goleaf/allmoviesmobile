## Issues Fixed During Merge

1. **Duplicate firebase_core dependency** in pubspec.yaml - Removed duplicate, kept version ^4.2.0
2. **Firebase version conflict** - Upgraded firebase_messaging from ^15.1.0 to ^16.0.3 for compatibility
3. **Multiple merge conflicts** - Resolved 20+ merge conflicts, preferring PR code in most cases

## Compilation Errors Found (Need Fixing)

The test run revealed several issues that need attention:

### 1. Missing File
- `lib/data/models/series_filter_preset.dart` is referenced but doesn't exist
  - Should be: `lib/data/models/tv_filter_preset.dart` (file was renamed in merge)

### 2. Missing RateLimiter Class
- `RateLimiter` class is used but not defined in `lib/data/tmdb_repository.dart`
- Needs implementation or import

### 3. CacheService Issues
- `lib/data/services/cache_service.dart:14` - Assert expression not constant
- `lib/data/services/cache_service.dart:577` - Logger.w() incorrect arguments

### 4. NetworkQualityService Issues
- API changes in connectivity_plus package
- `ConnectivityResult` changed from single value to `List<ConnectivityResult>`
- Needs update in `lib/data/services/network_quality_service.dart`

### 5. Test Issues
- `test/repository/tmdb_repository_test.dart` needs updates:
  - Missing ChangeNotifier implementation in mock
  - Missing getter `networkAwareDelayForTesting`
  - Missing method `delayForQualityForTesting`
  - Incorrect method signature for `refreshQuality`

## Next Steps Required

1. **Rename/Fix Missing File**:
   ```bash
   # Update imports from series_filter_preset to tv_filter_preset
   grep -r "series_filter_preset" lib/ --include="*.dart"
   ```

2. **Implement RateLimiter** or remove rate limiting functionality

3. **Fix CacheService**:
   - Make assert expression constant
   - Fix logger.w() call arguments

4. **Update NetworkQualityService**:
   - Handle `List<ConnectivityResult>` instead of single value
   - Update connectivity_plus API usage

5. **Fix Tests**:
   - Update mock classes
   - Add missing test helper methods
   - Fix method signatures

## Git Status

- ✅ All changes committed to local main
- ✅ All changes pushed to remote main
- ✅ All PR branches deleted from remote
- ✅ Clean git status (no uncommitted changes)

## Commands Used

```bash
# Merged 60+ PRs
git merge origin/codex/<branch-name> --no-edit

# Fixed conflicts by preferring PR code
git checkout --theirs <file>

# Deleted all remote PR branches
git push origin --delete codex/<branch-name>

# Pushed all changes
git push origin main
```

## Conclusion

All PR branches have been successfully merged and cleaned up. The codebase now contains all the new features and improvements from the PRs. However, compilation errors need to be fixed before the app can run successfully. The errors are well-documented above and should be straightforward to fix.
