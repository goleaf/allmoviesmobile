# Code Review Session – March 7, 2024

## Scope
- `lib/providers/movies_provider.dart`
- `lib/presentation/screens/movie_detail/movie_detail_screen.dart`

## Findings

1. **✅ Telemetry integration looks solid**  
   The new `_measureSectionFetch` helper keeps endpoint metadata adjacent to each TMDB request, and the aggregated getters (`lastFetchDurationsMs`, `lastTotalFetchDurationMs`) provide an easy integration point for developer tooling. The `PerformanceMonitor` tie-in ensures the diagnostics pipeline remains centralized. 【F:lib/providers/movies_provider.dart†L15-L116】【F:lib/providers/movies_provider.dart†L198-L283】

2. **⚠️ Consider surfacing metrics in UI**  
   Now that the provider records section timings, exposing them in a debug banner or DevTools extension would shorten the feedback loop for QA. A follow-up could add a lightweight developer-only widget on the home screen that reads from `MoviesProvider.lastFetchDurationsMs`. 【F:lib/providers/movies_provider.dart†L107-L118】【F:lib/providers/movies_provider.dart†L198-L283】

3. **⚠️ Collection navigation still pending**  
   The movie detail collection card continues to emit a TODO instead of navigating to `CollectionDetailScreen`. Wiring this tap handler would align the detail flow with the rest of the app’s deep-link coverage. 【F:lib/presentation/screens/movie_detail/movie_detail_screen.dart†L1020-L1051】

## Recommended next steps
- Add a debug-only overlay widget to visualize the newly collected refresh timings.
- Implement the outstanding collection navigation from movie detail pages.
- Continue expanding automated tests to validate that telemetry remains wired as providers evolve.
