## üìå Feature Breakdown

### 1. Follow System
- **Core Flows:** search users, view profile, follow/unfollow, manage followers list.
- **Data Needs:** user handle, display name, avatar, short bio, privacy flag.
- **Constraints:** private accounts require approval; add rate limits to prevent abuse.
- **Offline Story:** queue follow requests locally, sync when online; provide optimistic UI.

### 2. Activity Feed
- **Content Types:** new follows, review posts, likes/comments on owned reviews, badges earned, watch milestones.
- **Ranking:** reverse chronological fallback; plan for relevance scoring when data grows.
- **UX Touches:** filter tabs (All, Reviews, Milestones), contextual CTA buttons, spoiler tags.
- **Technical Notes:** feed service aggregates events; use cursor-based pagination; store last_seen markers per device.

### 3. Review Sharing
- **Composition:** structured editor with rating slider, text body, spoiler toggle, tags (genre, mood), sharing scope (public/followers/private).
- **Media:** auto-attach movie poster/still; allow one optional image upload (moderated).
- **Publishing:** drafts saved locally; ability to edit or delete; track revisions.
- **Discovery:** reviews surface on movie detail pages, global feed, profile timeline.

### 4. Reactions & Comments
- **Likes:** single-tap toggle; show avatars of recent likers; optional haptic feedback on mobile.
- **Comments:** threaded replies limited to one level; allow GIF/emoji; highlight creator comments.
- **Moderation:** report button, spam detection heuristics, word filters; block muted users.
- **Notifications:** push/in-app alerts when reviews receive interactions (respect user preferences).

### 5. User Profiles
- **Sections:** header (avatar, name, handle, bio, follow button), quick stats (followers, following, reviews, watch hours), badge gallery, activity timeline, favorites/watchlist preview.
- **Customization:** banner image, preferred genres, pinned review.
- **Privacy:** choose who can view full profile; visitor view respects blocked/muted states.
- **Edit Flow:** local form with validation; preview before publish.

### 6. Achievement Badges
- **Categories:** Watch Time (e.g., "Weekend Binge"), Diversity (genres/countries), Community (comments/likes), Discovery (new releases, top charts).
- **Progress Tracking:** streak counters, partial progress bars, upcoming badge hints.
- **Display:** badge detail sheet with unlock date, criteria, next level goals.
- **Gamification:** optional share to feed; remind users when near unlock thresholds.

### 7. Watch Statistics
- **Metrics:** total watch time, movies vs. series ratio, genre distribution, release year heatmap, top actors/directors.
- **Visualizations:** charts optimized for mobile (bar, donut, sparkline); accessible color palette.
- **Filters:** time ranges (7 days, 30 days, all time), per-device breakdown, languages.
- **Data Integrity:** reconcile offline logs with cloud storage using timestamp + content ID diffing.

### 8. Viewing History
- **Timeline:** chronological list grouped by day/week with contextual notes (where watched, completion status).
- **Actions:** mark as rewatched, add quick rating, jump to review composer, remove entry.
- **Sync:** conflict resolution via latest_modified timestamp; surface conflicts to user with merge UI.
- **Privacy:** option to keep history private or auto-share milestones only.

## üß© Cross-Cutting Considerations
- **Data Model Additions:** social graph collections, activity event schema, review entity with reactions, badge progress, watch logs.
- **Sync & Storage:** plan for hybrid model (local cache + optional authenticated cloud); adopt background sync jobs.
- **Moderation & Safety:** user blocking, content reporting, automated filters, escalation workflow for human review.
- **Notifications:** centralized preference center; channels for follows, interactions, badges, recommendations.
- **Permissions & Privacy:** GDPR-ready data export/delete, public/private toggles, parental controls.
- **Scalability:** design APIs with pagination, rate limiting, and eventual consistency.
- **Accessibility:** ensure interactive elements have semantics, high contrast, and keyboard navigation.

## üìÜ Implementation Phasing
1. **Foundation:** user profile schema, follow system, profile screens.
2. **Content:** review composer, movie detail integration, basic feed.
3. **Engagement:** likes/comments, notifications, moderation pipelines.
4. **Progression:** badges engine, watch statistics dashboards.
5. **History & Sync:** unified viewing history with offline-first conflict handling.

Each phase should include thorough QA, analytics instrumentation, localization updates, and rollout plans.

## ‚úÖ Next Steps
- Validate requirements with product/design stakeholders.
- Produce detailed UX wireframes and interaction specs.
- Define backend contracts (GraphQL/REST) and data migration strategy.
- Schedule technical spikes for sync/conflict resolution and moderation tooling.
- Align analytics events with product KPIs before development begins.
