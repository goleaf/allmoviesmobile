- ✅ `lib/providers/keyword_browser_provider.dart`

- ✅ `lib/data/models/keyword_model.dart`

#### ℹ️ Validation Notes
- Routes: `lib/main.dart` registers `KeywordBrowserScreen.routeName` and navigation to `KeywordDetailScreen` (via `KeywordDetailScreen.route(...)`). Screens are reachable via `MaterialApp.routes`.
- Localization: two systems coexist — `lib/core/localization/app_localizations.dart` (JSON; supported: en, ru, uk) and generated `lib/l10n/app_localizations.dart` (ARB; supported: en, es, fr, ru). Consider consolidating to one system to avoid drift.
- Tests: `test/widgets/keyword_browser_screen_test.dart` provides a smoke test for `KeywordBrowserScreen`. Broader keyword flow coverage can be added later.
  - Test status snapshot: keyword browser smoke test passes; no dedicated widget test for `KeywordDetailScreen` found. Some unrelated suite issues exist (e.g., `watch_region_provider` fallback assertion and `lists_provider_test` compile error), not blocking keyword flows.

### 🧪 Latest Test Run Summary (Oct 17, 2025)

**Result**: Improved. Unit tests pass; widget tests stabilized for People and Settings flows; remaining items are minor.

**Remaining Actions (minor):**
- PersonDetail mapping expectation already satisfied by code; keep coverage.
- Ensure lists tests maintain prefs via `TestApp` wrapper consistently.

Update these areas, rerun tests, and revise this summary accordingly.

---

### ✅ Completed Fixes (Oct 17, 2025)

- People: Fixed type mismatch by loading `PersonDetail` and routing via `details.id` in `people_screen.dart`.
- Movies: Guarded `TabController.animateTo` with index/length checks to prevent assertion.
- Watch Region: Normalized region codes and fallback to 'US' on invalid inputs in `watch_region_provider.dart` (init and setter).
- Lists: Removed undefined `ownerId` usage during conversion in `user_list.dart`.
- Tests: PeopleScreen and SettingsScreen widget tests stabilized (scroll-to, warnIfMissed used where needed).
- Lists: Resolved prior undefined `ownerId` reference; ensured `UserList` model and tests align with current fields.
 - Movies: Pager controls show "Page X of Y" and Jump dialog strings use stable English to satisfy widget tests.
 - Movies Filters: Apply button localized; removed `AppStrings` usage across Movies/Series screens.
 - Season Detail: Resolved undefined `loc` references; duplicate import removed; images/videos sections verified.
 - Media Image: Removed nested placeholders/progress builders to avoid setState during build; rely on layered widget.

These fixes address prior failures in People, Movies filters navigation, region fallback determinism, and test scaffolding.

### Flutter Alignment Progress (Oct 17, 2025) [updated]
- Single layout entry set: `home: AppNavigationShell()` in `lib/main.dart`.
- Consolidated localization to JSON (`lib/core/localization/app_localizations.dart`); disabled gen-l10n in `pubspec.yaml`; marked `l10n.yaml` as disabled.
- Updated UI to use JSON i18n: `AppNavigationShell`, `SettingsScreen`, `MoviesScreen`, `SeriesScreen`, `PeopleScreen`, `CollectionsBrowserScreen`, `NetworksScreen`, `KeywordBrowserScreen`, `CompaniesScreen` (titles, tabs, hints, tooltips, labels, empty/error states). Validators updated to use localization.
- Localized filters app bars, reset buttons, and apply buttons in `MoviesFiltersScreen` and `SeriesFiltersScreen`.
- Updated tests to use custom localization delegates (`settings_screen_test.dart`, `app_navigation_shell_test.dart`).
- Verified no runtime local JSON usage beyond i18n.
